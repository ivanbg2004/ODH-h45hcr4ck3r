# OD&H Hash Cracker

A powerful and professional hash cracking tool brought to you by Oblivion Development & Hosting (OD&H).  This tool provides efficient methods for cracking password hashes, including dictionary attacks and brute-force techniques.

## Overview

The OD&H Hash Cracker is a Python-based tool designed for security professionals and enthusiasts to test the strength of password hashes.  It offers:

*   **Support for common hash algorithms:** MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, and more.
*   **Wordlist-based cracking:** Attempts to crack the hash by comparing it against a list of potential passwords.
*   **Brute-force cracking:** Attempts to crack the hash by generating and testing all possible password combinations within a specified character set and length range.
*   **Timing for performance analysis:** Tracks the time taken to crack the hash.
*   **Object-oriented design:** Makes the code modular, extensible, and easy to maintain.
*   **Clear and informative output:** Provides progress updates and error messages.

**Developed and Maintained by Oblivion Development & Hosting (OD&H)**

## Features

*   **Hash Algorithm Support:** Supports a wide range of hash algorithms via Python's `hashlib` library.
*   **Wordlist Attack:**  Efficiently cracks passwords using a provided wordlist file. Handles different character encodings.
*   **Brute-Force Attack:** Customizable brute-force attack with user-defined character sets, minimum length, and maximum length.
*   **Attack Prioritization:** The `auto` attack mode prioritizes wordlist attacks before attempting brute-force.
*   **Clear Reporting:** Provides clear output of password cracking attempts, including the attack type and number of passwords tried.
*   **Timing:** Tracks the total runtime of the tool.
*   **Error Handling:** Handles common errors, such as invalid hash types, missing wordlist files, and invalid user inputs.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ivanbg2004/ODH-h45hcr4ck3r.git
    cd odh-hash-cracker
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (if any - likely not needed for this script, but good practice):**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python hash_cracker.py
    ```

2.  **Follow the prompts:**

    *   Enter the hash to crack.
    *   Enter the hash algorithm (e.g., `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`).
    *   Choose an attack type:
        *   `wordlist`: Uses a wordlist file.
        *   `brute-force`: Uses a brute-force attack.
        *   `rainbow-table`: (Not fully implemented)  A placeholder for future rainbow table support.
        *   `auto`: Attempts wordlist attack first, then brute-force if a wordlist is provided and brute-force settings are configured.
    *   Provide the necessary information based on the attack type you selected (wordlist path, character set, minimum length, maximum length).

## Example

```
  _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
 / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
( O | D | & | H |   | H | A | S | H )
 \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/
  _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
 / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
(   | C | R | A | C | K | E | R |   )
 \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/
